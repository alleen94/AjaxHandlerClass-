AjaxHandlerClass
=================

@version 1.0

The Ajax Handler Class is a javascript class to handle your ajax requests with text responses and the treatment of some exceptions.

I do plan to include a xml response treatment in the future.

I'm open to critics and ideas i hope you guys can enjoy it and help making it even better. (:
